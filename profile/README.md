WhyDRS is a free educational resource about the financial markets in the United States – specifically direct registration, a method of personal ownership available to everyone but rarely used. Keeping long investments in your own name - [with the SEC approved Direct Registration System](https://www.sec.gov/resources-for-investors/investor-alerts-bulletins/investorpubsholdsechtm) - provides multiple benefits and safeties not available through other means.
