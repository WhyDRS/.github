WhyDRS is a free educational resource about the financial markets in the United States – specifically direct registration, a method of personal ownership available to everyone but rarely used. Keeping long investments in your own name - [with the SEC approved Direct Registration System](https://www.sec.gov/resources-for-investors/investor-alerts-bulletins/investorpubsholdsechtm) - provides multiple benefits and safeties not available through other means.

## Welcome to GitHub!

GitHub is an online hosting platform which encourages community, participation, and transparency. It is the preferred choice for collaboration on open source efforts and code around the world. It comes with it's own lingo - repositories and pull requests, for example. [Here's a link to GitHub's native "Get Started" guide.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world)

## Goals

WhyDRS is a community focused on providing free, accessible, and well-sourced information about the financial markets and centralized custody and settlement system. WhyDRS also looks to encourage independent shareholder activism alongside broader regulatory petitioning in order to move towards a more equitable, transparent, and custody-first market structure. 

## Current Projects
